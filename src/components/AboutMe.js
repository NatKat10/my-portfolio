<p>
      I'm a recent Software and Information Systems Engineering graduate from Ben-Gurion University, with a strong interest in both backend and frontend development. I've honed my skills in various programming languages and environments, consistently aiming for clean, efficient code and effective problem-solving.      </p>
      <p>
      Throughout my studies and internships, I've gained hands-on experience with technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, Vue.js, and Flask. One of my key projects, the Evo Genes Project, involved creating an interactive tool for visualizing gene sequences, which deepened my interest in data visualization. I also developed the Foodie Recipes Project, combining my backend and frontend skills to provide a dynamic recipe exploration platform.      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <p>
      I interned at Cybereason, contributing to the Automation Team on CI/CD pipelines and testing frameworks, and worked in technical support roles at Tamar Handasa and Bezeq, which enhanced my problem-solving skills and ability to communicate with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.      </p>
      <p>
      Currently based in Be'er Sheva, Iâ€™m open to relocating for the right opportunity. I'm eager to join a forward-thinking company where I can grow as a developer, collaborate with talented teams, and contribute to innovative projects.      </p>
