      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a recent graduate in Software and Information Systems Engineering from Ben-Gurion University. During my studies, I developed a deep interest in both backend and frontend development, honing my skills in various programming languages and environments. My adaptability and attention to detail have always driven me to produce clean, efficient code and to tackle complex problems with determination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Throughout my academic journey and internships, I’ve gained hands-on experience with a diverse set of technologies. I’ve worked with Node.js and MongoDB on backend systems, and I’ve built user-friendly interfaces using frameworks like Vue.js and Flask. These experiences have not only strengthened my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of effective communication and teamwork in a collaborative environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my most rewarding projects was the Evo Genes Project, where I created an interactive tool for visualizing gene sequence similarities and structures. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge in Flask and Vue.js, as well as to develop a keen interest in data visualization. I also enjoyed developing the Foodie Recipes Project, a dynamic recipe exploration website that combined my backend and frontend skills, providing users with an extensive range of culinary options.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work experience includes an internship at Cybereason, where I contributed to the Automation Team by working on CI/CD pipelines and testing frameworks. This role enhanced my understanding of version control, continuous integration, and the importance of reliable, automated testing in software development. My technical support roles at Tamar Handasa and Bezeq further developed my problem-solving skills and taught me how to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently based in Be'er Sheva, I’m open to relocating to another city for the right opportunity. I’m excited about the prospect of joining a forward-thinking company where I can continue to grow as a developer, collaborate with talented teams, and make a meaningful contribution to innovative projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a quick learner, always eager to take on new challenges, and I thrive in environments where I can work closely with others to achieve common goals. I look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills and passion for technology to a dynamic and supportive workplace.
